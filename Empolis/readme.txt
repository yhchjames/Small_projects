TASK1

The code of task1 is 'task1.py'. You have to install couple packages if you would like to run it.

I have to solve two problem for task1. First is identify the transition points. Second is building a model. 'task1_tran_id.png' shows my result of first problem. The light blue line is showing the transition points. For second problem, because of the unbalance data set, I discarded a big part of data without sound value. And I trained the lightbgm model with the remaining data. The result is shown in 'task1_training.pdf' and 'task1_feature_importance.pdf'.

TASK2

The code of task2 is 'task2.py'. You have to install 'pandas' and 'numpy' to run it.

The comment in the file explains the corresponding parts to the rules. Runing the code gives you two files, 'nelson_rules_checking.csv', the result of the task, and 'calculation_for_nrules.csv', the calculation process.
